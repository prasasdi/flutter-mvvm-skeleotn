A new Flutter project. With MVVM capabilities, elevated with GetX in order to achieve low boilerplate and such


## Edit August 18 2024

This repository been used for me personally to develop a Tab application, so in general it should be give you an idea about communication between view and view-model are
Or, here's what you can do

### To-Do

1. I create an main-container where navbar and a view-controller are. Can you make it where the side nav-bar like X? If you can, you are wellcome to try it yourself
2. There's a view-control controlled by the nav-bar. Go for it experiment with it

> Q: Should I use immutable in order to utilize Rx?

No, of course not. That's why I utilize Rx for Mutable as well!

## Edit August 18 2024

I originally prepare this repository to show how GetX are able to, but what really happen is i do develop it further into an Tab application by giving a navigation and a widgets, and so you'll see some bugs regarding the view. Other than that the view-model works perfectly well
